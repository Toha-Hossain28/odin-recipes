            <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly in cold water and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Heat ghee and vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan or a pressure cooker.</li>
                <li>Add cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, green cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaves to the hot oil. Sauté them until they release their aroma.</li>
                <li>Add thinly sliced onions to the pan and cook them until they turn golden brown. Keep stirring occasionally to ensure even browning.</li>
                <li>Now, add ginger-garlic paste to the pan and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                <li>Add the mutton pieces to the pan and cook them on medium heat until they are browned on all sides.</li>
                <li>Add chopped tomatoes, green chilies, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and biryani masala powder to the pan. Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften.</li>
                <li>Add yogurt to the mixture and stir it in. Let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt and the soaked, drained basmati rice to the boiling water. Cook the rice until it is 70-80% cooked (parboiled). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Once the mutton is cooked and tender, remove half of the mutton mixture from the pan and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Spread the remaining mutton mixture evenly in the pan. Layer the parboiled rice over the mutton layer. Make sure to spread it evenly.</li>
                <li>Optional: Dissolve a pinch of saffron strands in warm milk and drizzle it over the rice for added flavor and color.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the chopped fresh mint leaves and coriander leaves over the rice. Place the sliced lemons on top.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Cook the biryani on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook through.</li>
                <li>Once done, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for a few minutes, allowing the steam to settle.</li>
                <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the layers of rice and mutton.</li>
                <li>Serve the aromatic mutton biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or salan (spicy curry) on the side</li>
            </ol>
